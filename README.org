* envelope

envelope is a streamlined Clojure library that serves as a convenient
wrapper around the Jakarta Mail (formerly JavaMail) API. It simplifies
the process of sending emails over SMTP by providing a more idiomatic
Clojure interface.

** Usage

*** Creating multipart emails

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  ;; All the functions used in this example which are not from
  ;; clojure.core namespace are from envelope.core namespace

  (require '[envelope.core :refer all])

  (let [username "sauravapprehensiveice@outlook.com"
        password "sauravs95@"
        props (properties username "smtp-mail.outlook.com" "587")
        session (create-session! props username password)
        ;; Multimedia part
        html1 (html-part "<h1>Hello World</h1>")
        html2 (html-part "<h2>Hello World</h2>")
        multi (multi-part)
        message (mime-message username
                              "saurav.kudajadri@gmail.com"
                              "Subject"
                              "Saurav"
                              session)]
    ;; Attach body to multipart
    (attach-body multi html1)
    (attach-body multi html2)
    ;; Set content of the message
    (set-content message multi)
    ;; Send the email
    (send-email! message))
